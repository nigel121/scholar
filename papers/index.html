    <span class="notice">Various aspects of computational thinking (CT) could be supported by educational contexts such as simulations and video-games construction. In this field study, potential differences in student motivation and learning were empirically examined through students’ code. For this purpose, we performed a teaching intervention that took place over five weeks, with two-hour sessions per week, plus two more weeks for the pretest and post-test projects. Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects’ code analysis. Moreover, the video-game context seems to better motivate students for future engagement with computing activities.</span>

    <span class="notice">Many educational organizations are employing instructional video
in their pedagogy, but there is limited understanding of the possible presentation styles. In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from a direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera and screencasts with voice-over, up to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work evaluated the effectiveness of several presentation styles, but there has not been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and meta-analyses possible. In this article, we surveyed the research literature and we examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by diverse educational organizations and teachers across various academic disciplines. We organized video lectures in two dimensions according to the level of human presence and according to the type of instructional media. In addition to organizing existing video lectures in a comprehensive way, the proposed taxonomy offers a design space that facilitates the choice of a suitable presentation style, as well as the preparation of new ones.</span>

    <span class="notice">Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73%±10% of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57%±7% of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80%–89% of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90% of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72% of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p\textless0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.</span>

    <span class="notice">Embodiment within robotics can serve as an innovative approach to attracting students to computer programming. Nevertheless, there is a limited number of empirical studies in authentic classroom environments to support this assumption. In this study, we explored the synergy between embodied learning and educational robotics through a series of programming activities. Thirty-six middle school students were asked to create applications for controlling a robot using diverse interaction modalities, such as touch, speech, hand and full body gestures. We measured students’ preferences, views, and intentions. Further- more, we evaluated students’ interaction modalities selections during a semi- open problem-solving task. The results revealed that students felt more confident about their programming skills after the activities. Moreover, participants chose interfaces that were attractive to them and congruent to the programming tasks.</span>

    <span class="notice">Pedagogy has emphasized that physical representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. There are many tangible hardware platforms for introducing computer programming to children, but there is limited comparative evaluation of them in the context of a formal classroom. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning to code for tangible computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for the desktop computer. For this purpose, 36 students participated in a within-groups study that involved three types of target computer platform tangibility. 1) desktop, 2) wearable, and 3) robotic. We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the students’ performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision). Our findings suggest that computer programming should be introduced through multiple target platforms (e.g., robots, smartphones, wearables) to engage children.</span>

    <span class="notice">Digital geographical maps can be regarded as a user interface for understanding and navigating the city. Nevertheless, contemporary digital maps over-emphasize the needs of motor vehicles. Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.</span>

    <span class="notice">Research into educational technology has evaluated new computer-based systems as tools for improving
students’ academic performance and engagement. Serious games should also be considered as an alternative pedagogical medium for
attracting students with different needs and expectations. In this field study, we empirically examined different forms of
serious-game use for learning on learning performance and attitudes of eighty 13-year-old students in the first grade of middle
school. Divided into four groups of 20 students, each group practiced with a maths video game in three ways. The first group
played the storytelling maths game, the second played the same game but with no story and the third played and modified the
video game. Finally, a control group practised in a paper-based (traditional) way by solving exercises. Although only minor
differences in learning performance were identified, we found significant differences in the attitudes of the students toward
learning through the video game. Students who are not motivated by conventional paper-based assignments might be engaged better
with the use of a video game. Our findings suggest that video game pedagogy could provide malleable learning for different
groups of students using methods that move beyond the conventional tool-based approach.</span>

    <span class="notice">Co-located collaboration on large vertical screens has become technically feasible, but users are faced with
increased effort, or have to wear intrusive personal identifiers. Previous research on co-located collaboration has assumed
that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in
turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during
shared tasks (Fig. 1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig. 1b) and personal action windows (Fig. 1c) for
co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for
it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords
performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task,
which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users’
behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space
negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and
interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along
with personal action windows.</span>

    <span class="notice">Epidemiology has made advances, thanks to the availability of real-time surveillance data and by leveraging
the geographic analysis of incidents. There are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford further processing and analysis. Existing
systems have emphasized the collection, analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular and
interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time data. As a remedy, we have built an
open-source project and we have been operating an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in
real-time with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number of precisely geo-located status
updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
flu-positive reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open- source approach and offer
linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem of applications and services, and in order to be
transparent to the general public interest.</span>

    <span class="notice">Learning to program in computer code has been considered one of the pillars of contemporary education with
benefits that reach well beyond the skills required by the computing industry, into creativity and self-expression.
Nevertheless, the execution of computer programs usually takes place on a traditional desktop computer, which has a limited
repertoire of input and output interfaces to engage with the user. On the other hand, pedagogy has emphasized that physical
representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. In this work, we explore the
benefits of learning to code for ubiquitous computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for
the desktop computer. For this purpose, thirty-six students participated in a within groups study that involved three types of
tangibility at the target computer platform: 1) desktop with Scratch, 2) wearable with Arduino LilyPad, and 3) robotic with
Lego Mindstorms. Regardless of the target platform, we employed the same desktop visual programming environment (MIT Scratch,
Modkit and Enchanting) and we measured emotional engagement and assessed students’ programming skills. We found that students
expressed more positive emotions while programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible
computing platforms didn’t affect dramatically students’ performance in computational thinking.</span>

    <span class="notice">Despite the increasing use of Multi-Touch (MT) capable devices, novel interaction techniques need to be
examined in order to swift from a single-touch WIMP interaction paradigm to a MT one.In this work, we focus on chord
interaction on vertical MT screens. Chord is the simultaneous touch of more than one finger on the MT screen. Based on a user
experiment with 12 users, we explore the positioning - interaction space of the chord technique, by investigating a relation
among the type of the chord (number of fingers) and the position on the screen that the chord was applied. The empirical
results have indicated an interaction pattern that demonstrates a significant relation between the type of the chord that was
applied (number of fingers) and its position on the screen. Our results show that as the number of fingers needed for a chord
increases, the nearer from the bottom left of the screen this chord is to be applied. Notably, our results give evidence of the
fact that there is a threshold (five-finger-chord) beyond which the above relation is not strong.</span>

    <span class="notice">The information conveyed via the social media, in addition to the content data, also contains social
characteristics that come from the social network users. A special interesting data category concerns the data that come from
the natural language present in the social media mainly in the form of video. Our study focuses on the speech content of the
videos in the form of transcript and the opinion of the social network users that have watched them. The representation of
content data is made through a vector space model that uses cosine similarity measure for the relevant ranking of the
transcripts. In order for the ranking to be more comprehensive we suggest the addition of a new parameter that of social weight
during the procedure, which will reflect the users’ opinion. There is an analytic presentation of the method being suggested;
all the possible cases are being examined and the rules that define the new ranking are put forward. Furthermore, we apply this
method to video lectures derived from YouTube. The findings of the experiments show that the addition of the social weight
parameter reflects the users’ views without changing to great extent the content based ranking of the video lectures. Finally,
a user evaluation experiment was carried out and showed that the ranking procedure that includes the social weight parameter is
closer to the users’ ranking preferences.</span>

    <span class="notice">Online video lectures have been considered an instructional media for various pedagogic approaches, such as
the flipped classroom and open online courses. In comparison to other instructional media, online video affords the opportunity
for recording student clickstream patterns within a video lecture. Video analytics within lecture videos may provide insights
into student learning performance and inform the improvement of video-assisted teaching tactics. Nevertheless, video analytics
are not accessible to learning stakeholders, such as researchers and educators, mainly because online video platforms do not
broadly share the interactions of the users with their systems. For this purpose, we have designed an open-access video
analytics system for use in a video-assisted course. In this paper, we present a longitudinal study, which provides valuable
insights through the lens of the collected video analytics. In particular, we found that there is a relationship between video
navigation (repeated views) and the level of cognition/thinking required for a specific video segment. Our results indicated
that learning performance progress was slightly improved and stabilized after the third week of the video-assisted course. We
also found that attitudes regarding easiness, usability, usefulness, and acceptance of this type of course remained at the same
levels throughout the course. Finally, we triangulate analytics from diverse sources, discuss them, and provide the lessons
learned for further development and refinement of video-assisted courses and practices.</span>

    <span class="notice">Educational games have been employed in many settings as a means to engage young students. Different genres
and applications of games have been used to improve learning experience. The design or making of games in learning activities
has been linked to teaching of new skills. Within this paper we explore and discuss the differences of involving young students
into the game design and development process compared to just playing an educational game. In particular, we designed an
educational math-game and an activity that involves children in playing or modifying the game, and we performed a between
groups experiment with sixty students of the second grade of middle school (12 to 13 years old). Students formed three
equivalent groups of twenty. The first group played the game, the second engaged with re-designing and modifying the game and
the third (control) group solved the same exercises (with the educational game) on paper. The results showed that the making
group exhibits certain attitudinal benefits. Hence, our findings suggest that learning through games should include more than
just playing a well-designed game, it should also consider the involvement of students with various making affordances.</span>

    <span class="notice">During the last few years, the focus of computer science education (CSE) in primary and secondary schools
(shortly K-12) have reached a significant turning point. This study reviews the published papers on the field of K-12 computing
education in order to summarize the findings, guide future studies and give reflections for the major achievements in the area
of CSE in K-12 schools. 47 peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed, based on a
categorization of their main elements. Programming tools, educational context, and instructional methods are the main examined
categories of this research. Results of this survey show the direction of CSE in schools research during the last years and
summarized the benefits as well as the challenges. In particular, we analyzed the selected papers from the perspective of the
various instructional methods aiming at introducing and enhancing learning, using several programming tools and educational
context in K-12 CSE. Despite the challenges, the findings suggest that implementing computing lessons in K-12 education could
be an enjoyable and effective learning experience. In addition, we suggest ways to facilitate deep learning and deal with
various implications of the formal and informal education. Encouraging students to create their own projects or solve problems
should be a significant part of the learning process.</span>

    <span class="notice">There is growing interest in the employment of serious video games in science education, but there are no
clear design principles. After surveying previous work in serious video game design, we highlighted the following design
principles: 1) engage the students with narrative (hero, story), 2) employ familiar gameplay mechanics from popular video
games, 3) engage students into constructive trial and error game-play and 4) situate collaborative learning. As illustrated
examples we designed two math video games targeted to primary education students. The gameplay of the math video games embeds
addition operations in a seamless way, which has been inspired by that of classic platform games. In this way, the students are
adding numbers as part of popular gameplay mechanics and as a means to reach the video game objective, rather than as an end in
itself. The employment of well-defined principles in the design of math video games should facilitate the evaluation of
learning effectiveness by researchers. Moreover, educators can deploy alternative versions of the games in order to engage
students with diverse learning styles. For example, some students might be motived and benefited by narrative, while others by
collaboration, because it is unlikely that one type of serious video game might fit all learning styles. The proposed
principles are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but a starting point for extending the list and applying them in other cases
of serious video games beyond mathematics and learning.</span>

event detection has focused on content-based techniques, such as pattern recognition algorithms that attempt to understand the
contents of a video. There are few user-centric approaches that have considered either search keywords, or external data such
as comments, tags, and annotations. Moreover, some of the user-centric approaches imposed an extra effort to the users in order
to capture required information. In this research, we are describing a method for the analysis of implicit users’ interactions
with a web video player, such as pause, play, and thirty-seconds skip or rewind. The results of our experiments indicated that
even the simple user heuristic of local maxima might effectively detect the same video-events, as indicated manually. Notably,
the proposed technique was more accurate in the detection of events that have a short duration, because those events motivated
increased user interaction in video hot-spots. The findings of this research provide evidence that we might be able to infer
semantics about a piece of unstructured data just from the way people actually use it.</span>

the user information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. Then, we
have calculated the correlation coefficient between the dynamically detected pulses at the local maximums of the user activity
signal and the pulse of reference. We have found that users Replay activity significantly matches the important segments in
information-rich and visually complex videos, such as lecture, how-to, and documentary. The proposed signal processing of user

Accordingly, it is proposed that the aggregated users’ video activity exhibits characteristic patterns. Such patterns may be

end, experimentation is based on users’ interactions (e.g., pause, seek/scrub) that have been gathered in a controlled user

probability distribution function. Thus, it is argued that the bell-shaped reference patterns are shown to significantly

with no story, and the third was engaged with modifying the game code. Finally, the last (control) group practiced

    <span class="notice">Catch-up TV services on the Web have facilitated time-shifted TV viewing. However, there is limited
information about user search behavior with regard to recently time-shifted versus archival TV content. We deployed two
distinct content-based web services to explore information retrieval of time-shifted TV content. The first web service is based
on a browsing metaphor, while the second is based on free text content search metaphor. We analyzed more than 5000 user
sessions from 12 months of logs and found that the programs accessed via browsing categorized program content summaries were
typically less than one week old. In contrast, the programs accessed via free text search on subtitle content were typically
more than a week old. Our findings provide a first assessment of user behavior in accessing time-shifted and archival TV
content. Further research should develop the user experience for content-based TV access and explore the sharing patterns of
archival TV content on social networks.</span>

    <span class="notice">Content-based video retrieval has been a very efficient technique with new video content, but it has not
regarded the increasingly dynamic interactions between users and content. We present a comprehensive survey on user-based
techniques and instrumentation for social video retrieval researchers. Community-based approaches suggest there is much to
learn about an unstructured video just by analyzing the dynamics of how it is being used. In particular, we explore three
pillars of online user activity with video content: 1) Seeking patterns within a video is linked to interesting video segments,
2) Sharing patterns between users indicate that there is a correlation between social activity and popularity of a video, and
3) Editing of live events is automated through the synchronization of audio across multiple viewpoints of the same event.
Moreover, we present three complementary research methods in social video retrieval: Experimental replication of user activity
data and signal analysis, data mining and prediction on natural user activity data, and hybrid techniques that combine robust
content-based approaches with crowd sourcing of user gener- ated content. Finally, we suggest further research directions in
the combination of richer user- and content-modeling, because it provides an attractive solution to the personalization,
navigation, and social consumption of videos.</span>

    <span class="notice">We present a user-based approach for detecting interesting video segments through simple signal processing
of users collective interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). Previous research has focused on
content-based systems that have the benefit of analyzing a video without user interactions, but they are monolithic, because
the resulting key-frames are the same regardless of the user preferences. We developed the open-source SocialSkip system on a
modular cloud-based architecture and analyzed hundreds of user interactions within difficult video genres (lecture, how-to,
documentary) by modeling them as user interest time series. We found that the replaying activity is better than the skipping
forward one in matching the semantics of a video, and that all interesting video segments can be found within a factor of two
times the average user skipping step from the local maximums of the replay time series. The concept of simple signal processing
of implicit user interactions within video could be applied to any type of Web video system (e.g., TV, desktop, tablet), in
order to improve the user navigation experience with dynamic and personalized key-frames.</span>

mobile applications. Educators and museum curators recognise the value of interactivity, but the optimum level of interactivity
in informal learning remains unclear. We developed an informal learning activity with quiz questions about art theory, which we
integrated in a between–groups experimental design with three groups of high–school students at an art gallery. Each of the
three groups received a different treatment: (a) an interactive mobile–based learning activity, (b) a paper–based version of
the same learning activity, and (c) a self–guided museum tour. Students who enrolled with the interactive version showed higher
performance in the post–assessment test when compared to the paper–based version. Notably, the benefits of the interactive
version are attributed to the immediate feedback of the quiz application during the visit. Further research should perform
similar controlled experiments in order to assess the learning benefit of more immersive interactive systems, such as
three–dimensional graphics and augmented reality.</span>

verify our idea we have extended the YouTube video player into the VideoSkip system. In addition, VideoSkip uses a web-database
(Google Application Engine) to keep a record of some important parameters, such as the timing of basic user actions (play,
pause, skip). Moreover, we implemented an algorithm that selects representative thumbnails. Finally, we populated the system
with data from an experiment with nine users. We found that the VideoSkip system indexes video content by leveraging implicit
users interactions, such as pause and thirty seconds skip. Our early findings point toward improvements of the web video player
and its thumbnail generation technique. The VideSkip system could compliment content-based algorithms, in order to achieve
efficient video-indexing in difficult videos, such as lectures or sports.</span>

    <span class="notice">In this paper, we present a system that facilitates the analysis of user activity within a web video.
Previous research in user-based techniques has assumed an extra effort from the users, such as video replies, comments, tags,
and annotations. We have developed and evaluated the SocialSkip system, which improves sense making of web videos by
visualizing the simplest form of user interactions with video, such as pause, and seek. In contrast to previous stand-alone
implementations, the SocialSkip system employs a web-video player and cloud-based resources (application logic, database,
content). The system was validated with two user studies, which provided several hundreds of user interactions with five types
of web video (sports, comedy, lecture, documentary, how-to). We found that seeking activity within web video is reversely
proportional to how interesting the video is. Moreover, we suggest that if the users are actively seeking for information
within a video (e.g., lecture, how-to), then the user activity graph could be associated with the semantics of the video.
Finally, SocialSkip provides an open architecture for collaborative contributions to the analysis of the user activity data, in
a fashion similar to the TRECVID workshop series.</span>

group of children, who exchanged video messages in an informal context. In particular, we have analyzed 386 videos over a
period of 11 weeks, which were exchanged by 30 students of 4 th and 5 th grade from USA and Greece. We found that the number of
views and the duration of a video message significantly depend on the gender of the viewer and creator. Most notably, girls
created more messages, but boys viewed their own messages more. Finally, there are video messages with numerous views, which
indicates that some videos have content qualities beyond the communication message itself. Overall, the practical implications
of these findings indicate that the developers of asynchronous VMC should consider functionalities for preserving some of the
video messages.</span>

users which derive from their Facebook experience. In the exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner
they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users do not only describe the uses, but also mention how they perceive these uses.
These phrases were coded into 14 items and then clustered into 4 factors. The second stage of the study, which was addressed to
131 Facebook users, the factor analysis that was conducted, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection,
Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time, Using Applications. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to interpret each
factor’s impact and to enable a comparison with previous research regarding the same subject. These showed how users continue
to primarily regard Facebook as a means of socializing with other users, but also the extent to which Facebook has become a
part of their daily routine, something that is indicated by the impact of the "Wasting Time" factor. Further research can be
conducted by addressing a greater number of users, selected with a less random manner and possibly with a different (cultural,
economical etc.) background.</span>

    <span class="notice">Mobile phones have become a ubiquitous information and telecommunication terminal used by diverse age
groups. Despite research findings that indicate the special needs and skills of senior citizens, contemporary handsets offer
limited consideration for them. We investigated whether typical mobile phone icons are suitable for older users, as measured
through unaided icon comprehension. For this purpose, we studied 38 users and evaluated 25 icons, which we captured from five
different handsets. It was found that there are significant differences in icon comprehension performance between older and
younger mobile phone users. We conclude that designers of mobile phone icons have to regard older user groups differently and
we describe the qualities of icons suitable to each one of the age groups. Finally, we highlight the need for additional
similar research in different ethnic and cultural groups.</span>

    <span class="notice">The approach often adopted by Human Computer Interaction (HCI) focuses on exchanges between a person and the
interface of a device situated within a specific context of use. This view is increasingly challenged by the complex and
dynamic world of the physical and social environment integrated with ubiquitous technologies, which requires an alternative
view that sees people creating settings which frame and structure their encounters. As a result, in recent years, HCI
researchers have recognized the need for social and physical data to be gathered and interpreted, but have often been
frustrated in their attempts to codify and make sense of the complex and dynamic nature of the real world of human experience.
Developments in the early 90s such as the emergence of the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW), the
introduction of the concept of social navigation (Hook et al. 2003), work on ambient environments, the UbiComp conference
series as well as more theoretical positions on embodied or situated interaction (Dourish 2001, McCullough 2005) have all lead
the way to a new understanding of HCI. Another driver for this change in emphasis in HCI is the emergence of mobile and
ubiquitous computing that has brought significant changes in social and cultural practices in spatial settings. Interactions
through and with ubiquitous technologies no longer require physical co-presence and have broadened the range of possible
interactions as well as the range of settings in which these interactions can unfold. The basis for this lies in the fact that
physical distance no longer prevents many of the types of interactions and encounters that had previously been confined to
face-to-face contact. As a result, there has been much discussion on the role of spatial setting and interaction mediated
through technologies such as that on the role of space and agency in the quality of the interaction (Dourish and Harrisson
1996) and also the broader concept of the situated behavior and actions (Suchman 1987). A good deal has also been written on
the subject of social collaboration among individuals using communication devices and the conditions or features that are
required to enable such activities (Gaver 1992; Paulos and Goodman 2004; Hook et al. 2003; Churchill et al. 2004). Further
discussion has focused on the technologies themselves, assessing the social impact of the emerging forms of behavior, such as
the activities of ad hoc communities enabled through mobile technologies (Rheingold 2002), or the patterns of mobile phones’
use (Katz and Aakhus 2002). Finally, numerous applications and locative media projects (e.g., Harle and Hopper 2005) which
explore interactions through realization have been developed. These projects and research offer many useful insights, but there
still remain many questions about how to create the conditions for meaningful and persisting shared interactions in public
space. The challenge is not only to build systems that respond to rich and dynamic social and physical events, but also to
provide a structure for sustainable participation and sharing.</span>

    <span class="notice">This article investigates whether the diversity of mobile phone icons has a negative effect on user
perception, as measured through unaided icon recognition. We designed an experiment involving fifty-two young users and
evaluated twenty-five icons from five different mobile phone handsets. It was found that there are significant differences
between alternative icons used for the same mobile phone feature. Moreover, we found that original manufacturer icons performed
better than those offered by the wireless operator. Simple metaphors from the real world and consistent visual depictions
across different handsets performed best for mobile phone icons, while abstract concepts had the lowest recognition rates.
Designers of mobile phone icons have to balance a trade-off between the need of the manufacturers and wireless operators to
differentiate their offerings through branding, and the need of the consumers for a familiar visual language in mobile phone

    <span class="notice">The ability to deliver personalized advertising messages has long been a major objective in marketing since
it allows marketers to meet heterogeneous consumer needs and target their messages more effectively (Arens &amp; Bovee, 1994).
However, traditional one-to-many marketing approaches applied in mass media suffer from their inability to meet this objective
(Dibb, 1998; Hoffman &amp; Novak, 1997). In order to increase the efficiency of their strategy, marketers identify homogeneous
groups of consumers (market segmentation) which they target according to their marketing objectives. Thus, market segmentation
has become the most important marketing tool for targeting purposes (McBurnie &amp; Clutterbuck, 1998), also utilized in the TV
advertising domain in conjunction with domain-specific features such as time zones and/or program typologies. However, this
strategy has admittedly little to offer towards the ultimate goal of one-to-one communication, since the targeted unit is the
segment rather than the individual consumer, and therefore individual needs cannot be satisfied. In the broadcasting television
advertising domain, media coverage either exceeds the targeted market segment or leaves potential customers without exposure to
the message, thus reducing its cost effectiveness (Belch &amp; Belch, 1995). At the same time, TV viewers have to deal with a
vast amount of available advertising information. The issue of information overload, typical in information theoretic terms, is
also experienced in the case of TV advertisements as advertising clutter, which has been identified as one of the significant
factors associated with the negative attitude of viewers towards advertising and can have a negative impact on television
advertisement recall or recognition (Mord &amp; Gilson, 1985). Relevant surveys reveal that 80% of the viewers feel that
there is “too much advertising in television” (Elliott &amp; Speck, 1998), while more than 75% of consumers are not happy
with the broadcasted advertisements (Hawkins, Best, &amp; Coney, 1998 ). Current target marketing methods are limited in their
ability to efficiently target consumers at the individual level, particularly in mass media such as television. Thus,
personalization of advertisements provides marketers with the opportunity to increase advertising effectiveness by targeting
consumers who are most likely to respond positively to the advertising message. The present article investigates appropriate
personalization methods for the domain of digital television advertisements by examining relevant methods utilized for
personalized Web applications. In addition, it is concerned with the design of the interactive elements of a typical 30-second
advertisement in support of the personalization process. The two objectives of this article are interrelated: the selection of
a personalization technique affects the design of interactive advertisements since it indicates the type of interaction data
that should be collected in order to enable personalization. The next section of this article opens up the discussion on
personalization from a theoretical point of view and in the following section specific personalization techniques are compared.
Next, the types of interaction data required to achieve personalization are discussed and the article concludes with further
discussion and conclusions.</span>

    <span class="notice">Interactive Television (ITV) applications gratify entertainment needs and leisure activities in a relaxed
domestic context. Then, the mentality of efficiency and task completion implied by many user interface heuristics may not be
suitable for design and expert evaluation of ITV. In line with the contemporary movement towards the design of the user
experience of computing systems, a set of design principles for ITV applications has been developed. Instead of information
technology, the field of communication science was explored, which has accumulated an extensive theory of TV usage and viewer
behavior. For the empirical validation, the principles were employed in the design of an interactive music TV application. The
results suggest that a small set of generic principles could support the systematic design of ITV applications and produce a
design rationale that is traceable and comparable to alternative solutions, during the process of early product development. In
addition, the principles could be refined into specific guidelines and further employed to support expert evaluation
techniques.</span>

Previous works on social television systems belong to two categories: 1) studies on how collocated groups of viewers socialize
while watching TV, and 2) studies on novel Social TV applications (e.g. experimental set-ups) and devices (e.g. ambient
displays) that provide technological support for TV sociability over a distance. The main shortcoming of those studies is that
they have not considered the dominant contemporary method of Social TV. Early adopters of technology have been watching and
sharing video online. We employed cultural probes in order to gain in-depth information about the social aspect of video
sharing on the internet. Our sample consisted of six heavy users of internet video, watching an average of at least one hour of
internet video a day. In particular, we explored how they are integrating video into their daily social communication
practices. We found that internet video is shared and discussed with distant friends. Moreover, the results of the study

    <span class="notice">Despite the progressive switch to digital TV, there has not been any significant change to the value chain
of the TV industry. At the same time, the introduction of novel information and communication technologies, such as the digital
video recorder (DVR) and efficient Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content distribution, have been regarded as a threat to the established
broadcast business players. Previous research has described these threats and has suggested competitive strategies, but it has
not investigated the opportunities. This work aims to identify a framework of new business models that take advantage of the
networked DVR. For this purpose, we examined the TV literature from diverse academic disciplines, such as mass communication,
computer engineering and advertising research. We have also collaborated with network and multimedia engineers, with
broadcasters, and we examined novel interactive television (ITV) prototypes. The findings suggest that the networked DVR could
be exploited to provide personalized channels and that the dynamic advertising insertion could be introduced as an effective
advertising format. In the light of these findings, the TV industry should consider the pro-active adoption and facilitation of
the networked DVR infrastructure.</span>

    <span class="notice">Television use does not require high skill or effort, which is ideal as a paradigm of use for ambient user
interfaces. In this paper, universal access in ambient intelligence is modeled after the use of TV in everyday life. Instead of
considering television only as a content medium and the focus of user activity, an alternative approach is to consider
television use as a secondary function to other activities, such as socializing, domestic chores, leisure pursuits. For this
purpose, the requirements for ambient user interactivity with TV are organized in a small set of design principles. The design
principles have been selected, analyzed and synthesized from readings in previous works on media and ethnographic studies about
television, and everyday life. It is suggested that universal access in ambient intelligence is promoted by considering design
principles such as opportunistic interaction, user participation, group interactions, and multiple levels of attention to the
user interface. Finally, the principles have been tested in the design of a user interface for interactive music television.
This preliminary case suggests that the proposed principles facilitate the design of user interfaces that blend seamlessly with
everyday life.</span>

artificial distinction between content distribution and interpersonal communication. As a result, content has to be distributed
and consumed through broadband, unidirectional and inflexible TV channels, while interpersonal communication takes place over
low-bandwidth bidirectional channels. The convergence of platforms offers many opportunities for integrated content and

    <span class="notice">A diverse user population employs interactive TV (ITV) applications in a leisure context for entertainment
purposes. The traditional user interface (UI) evaluation paradigm involving efficiency and task completion may not be adequate
for the assessment of such applications. In this paper, we argue that unless ITV applications are evaluated with consideration
for the ordinary TV viewer, they are going to be appropriate only for the computer literate user, thus excluding the TV
audience from easy access to information society services. The field of media studies has accumulated an extensive theory of TV
and associated methods. We applied the corresponding findings in the domain of ITV to examine how universal access to ITV
applications can be obtained. By combining these results with emerging affective quality theories for interactive products, we
propose a UI evaluation framework for ITV applications.</span>

    <span class="notice">Animated characters have been a popular research theme, but the respective desktop applications have not
been well-received by end-users. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an animated character for presenting
information and navigating music videos within an interactive television (ITV) application. Information was displayed over
music video clips with two alternative user interfaces: 1) semi-transparent information overlays, 2) an animated character. For
this purpose, the differences between ITV and desktop computing motivated the adaptation of the traditional usability
evaluation techniques. The evaluation revealed that users reported higher affective quality with the animated character user
interface. Although the success of animated characters in desktop productivity applications has been limited, there is growing
evidence that animated characters might be viable in a domestic environment for leisure activities, such as interactive TV.</span>

interactive television applications are deployed in a relaxed domestic setting and aim to gratify the need for entertainment.
Digital video recorders, the generation of custom computer graphics on each digital set-top box, and the introduction of new
advertising formats are important issues for research and practice. We explore the employment of an animated character and the
dynamic insertion of advertising in the design of an intuitive user interface for interactive music-video television. We found
that the animated character and the skippable videoclip feature seamlessly enhanced consumer satisfaction, as shown by

    <span class="notice">This research is based on the realization that the desktop computing paradigm is not appropriate for
television, because it is adapted to fundamentally different user aspirations and activities. Instead, the virtual channel is
proposed as a model that explains the proper design of user access to personalized television programming. The virtual channel
is a model that aids the organization and dynamic presentation of television programming from a combination of live broadcasts,
prerecorded content and Internet resources at each set-top box. In this paper, we describe two applications that have been used
to validate the virtual channel model. We have employed the properties of the virtual channel model into the design of
personalized television advertising and interactive music video clip programming. Finally, we describe an ActiveX control that

    <span class="notice">Following the case of the Internet, Interactive TV can be expected to revolutionise marketing practices and
lead to a paradigm shift in the way advertising is developed, conducted, and analysed. Interactive TV, combines the appeal and
mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available on the Web and offers new
possibilities for the viewer, who can directly access relevant information and other services being just one-click away. In
this context, personalisation of advertisements refers to the use of technology and viewer information in order to tailor
commercials and their respective interactive content to each individual viewer profile. In this paper we deal with the topic of
advertising over digital interactive TV and describe a specific approach to the delivery of personalised interactive
advertisement content to viewers based on their individual profile, focusing on the necessary architecture, mechanisms and user

    <span class="notice">This paper presents the innovative approach of the IST project iMEDIA towards Consumer Clustering and
Targeted Advertising in a Digital TV Environment. iMEDIA covers the need of Advertising Companies to identify broad classes of
TV viewers who will respond similarly to marketing actions, and thus develop their target advertising techniques. The consumers
are equipped with a settop box (STB) with storage facilities and a modem. The definition of consumer profiles and clusters is
based on demographics, preferences, and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV, which are tracked automatically. In
order to protect consumers’ identities, consumer data are stored locally on the STB and the classification of a consumer in a
specific cluster takes place at the client side. Consumer data from the consumers, who permit it, is periodically transferred
to the Server where Data Mining techniques are applied. The extracted consumer behavioral rules associate the clusters with
consumer profiles and interaction/navigational data and are sent through the broadcast channel to the consumers’ STBs for the
classification of each consumer and the playback of the advertisements that match consumer interests.</span>

opportunities that were previously unimaginable. The WWW allows advanced marketing activities and more particularly interactive
marketing, as the user is actively involved in responding to the vendor’s promotion campaign. Interactive TV, also referred to
as iTV, combines the appeal and mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available
on the Web. Although personalisation is a practice used widely on the Internet by many sites, applying personalisation
techniques over interactive television presents a number of difficulties. In this paper we focus on the design and testing
