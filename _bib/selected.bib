abstract      = {Many educational organizations are employing instructional video
in their pedagogy, but there is limited understanding of the possible presentation styles. In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from a direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera and screencasts with voice-over, up to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work evaluated the effectiveness of several presentation styles, but there has not been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and meta-analyses possible. In this article, we surveyed the research literature and we examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by diverse educational organizations and teachers across various academic disciplines. We organized video lectures in two dimensions according to the level of human presence and according to the type of instructional media. In addition to organizing existing video lectures in a comprehensive way, the proposed taxonomy offers a design space that facilitates the choice of a suitable presentation style, as well as the preparation of new ones.},

  abstract      = {Epidemiology has made advances, thanks to the availability of real-time surveillance data and by leveraging
the geographic analysis of incidents. There are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford further processing and analysis. Existing
systems have emphasized the collection, analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular and
interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time data. As a remedy, we have built an
open-source project and we have been operating an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in
real-time with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number of precisely geo-located status
updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
flu-positive reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open- source approach and offer
linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem of applications and services, and in order to be
transparent to the general public interest.},

immediate benefit to pedestrians, a pragmatic understanding of walking paths might facilitate urban planning and design, which

  abstract      = {There is growing interest in the employment of serious video games in science education, but there are no
clear design principles. After surveying previous work in serious video game design, we highlighted the following design
principles: 1) engage the students with narrative (hero, story), 2) employ familiar gameplay mechanics from popular video
games, 3) engage students into constructive trial and error game-play and 4) situate collaborative learning. As illustrated
examples we designed two math video games targeted to primary education students. The gameplay of the math video games embeds
addition operations in a seamless way, which has been inspired by that of classic platform games. In this way, the students are
adding numbers as part of popular gameplay mechanics and as a means to reach the video game objective, rather than as an end in
itself. The employment of well-defined principles in the design of math video games should facilitate the evaluation of
learning effectiveness by researchers. Moreover, educators can deploy alternative versions of the games in order to engage
students with diverse learning styles. For example, some students might be motived and benefited by narrative, while others by
collaboration, because it is unlikely that one type of serious video game might fit all learning styles. The proposed
principles are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but a starting point for extending the list and applying them in other cases
of serious video games beyond mathematics and learning.},

of users collective interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). Previous research has focused on
content-based systems that have the benefit of analyzing a video without user interactions, but they are monolithic, because
the resulting key-frames are the same regardless of the user preferences. We developed the open-source SocialSkip system on a
modular cloud-based architecture and analyzed hundreds of user interactions within difficult video genres (lecture, how-to,
documentary) by modeling them as user interest time series. We found that the replaying activity is better than the skipping
forward one in matching the semantics of a video, and that all interesting video segments can be found within a factor of two
times the average user skipping step from the local maximums of the replay time series. The concept of simple signal processing
of implicit user interactions within video could be applied to any type of Web video system (e.g., TV, desktop, tablet), in
order to improve the user navigation experience with dynamic and personalized key-frames.},

through unaided icon comprehension. For this purpose, we studied 38 users and evaluated 25 icons, which we captured from five
different handsets. It was found that there are significant differences in icon comprehension performance between older and
younger mobile phone users. We conclude that designers of mobile phone icons have to regard older user groups differently and
we describe the qualities of icons suitable to each one of the age groups. Finally, we highlight the need for additional
similar research in different ethnic and cultural groups.},

In particular, we study gender and appearance differences in social communication preferences and behavior in virtual public

for the study of cyberspace. Although we only employed nine users who used four different avatars, we observed a cumulative of
more than two hundreds social encounters. We found that users with more elaborate avatars had a higher success rate in their
social encounters, than those users with the default avatars. Most notably, female users selected to speak with male avatars
much more frequently, when using the attractive avatar, which indicates a self-confidence effect induced by the appearance of
the personal avatar.},

experience of computing systems, a set of design principles for ITV applications has been developed. Instead of information
technology, the field of communication science was explored, which has accumulated an extensive theory of TV usage and viewer
behavior. For the empirical validation, the principles were employed in the design of an interactive music TV application. The
results suggest that a small set of generic principles could support the systematic design of ITV applications and produce a
design rationale that is traceable and comparable to alternative solutions, during the process of early product development. In
addition, the principles could be refined into specific guidelines and further employed to support expert evaluation
techniques.},

propose a UI evaluation framework for ITV applications.},
