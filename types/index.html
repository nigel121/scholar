    <span class="notice">Various aspects of computational thinking (CT) could be supported by educational contexts such as simulations and video-games construction. In this field study, potential differences in student motivation and learning were empirically examined through students’ code. For this purpose, we performed a teaching intervention that took place over five weeks, with two-hour sessions per week, plus two more weeks for the pretest and post-test projects. Students were taught programming concepts through a science project; one group represented the function of a basic electric circuit by creating a simulation, while the other group represented the same function by creating a video game in which a player should achieve a score in order to win. Video game construction resulted in projects with higher CT skills and more primitives, as measured through projects’ code analysis. Moreover, the video-game context seems to better motivate students for future engagement with computing activities.</span>

    <span class="notice">Many educational organizations are employing instructional video
in their pedagogy, but there is limited understanding of the possible presentation styles. In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from a direct recording of classroom teaching with a stationary camera and screencasts with voice-over, up to highly elaborate video post-production. Previous work evaluated the effectiveness of several presentation styles, but there has not been any consistent taxonomy, which would have made comparisons and meta-analyses possible. In this article, we surveyed the research literature and we examined contemporary video-based courses, which have been produced by diverse educational organizations and teachers across various academic disciplines. We organized video lectures in two dimensions according to the level of human presence and according to the type of instructional media. In addition to organizing existing video lectures in a comprehensive way, the proposed taxonomy offers a design space that facilitates the choice of a suitable presentation style, as well as the preparation of new ones.</span>

    <span class="notice">Objectives Exergames can replace sedentary time spent on computer gaming with physical activity. Previous research has found exergaming to elicit light-to-moderate exercise intensity. Our primary aim was to examine the exercise intensity of a newly developed biking exergame. Methods Eight males (23.9±0.6 years) played the exergame (PLAY) and walked (WALK) on three separate occasions, with the condition counterbalanced and in random sequence within each day. They were asked to PLAY and WALK for a minimum of 15 min and then continue for as long as they wanted. We measured heart rate (HR), activity duration, caloric expenditure and subject-rated exertion and enjoyment (based on 0–10 Visual Analogue Scale, VAS). We used an average of each outcome variable across the 3 days in the analysis. Results The average intensity during PLAY (73%±10% of HRmax) was significantly higher than that during WALK (57%±7% of HRmax, p=0.01). Participants spent 12.5±5.3 min at 80%–89% of HRmax and 5.5±4.6 min at ≥90% of HRmax during PLAY, whereas intensity during WALK was ≤72% of HRmax. The duration of PLAY was 44.3±0.7 min and of WALK 17.0±0.7 min (p=0.01). The relative energy expenditure during PLAY was 7.6±0.7 kcal/min and during WALK 6.2±0.3 kcal/min (p\textless0.01). The enjoyment of PLAY (VAS 8.7±0.1) was higher than that of WALK (VAS 3.9±1.8, p=0.01). Conclusions Exergaming can be an innovative way of enjoyable high-intensity training.</span>

    <span class="notice">Pedagogy has emphasized that physical representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. There are many tangible hardware platforms for introducing computer programming to children, but there is limited comparative evaluation of them in the context of a formal classroom. In this work, we explore the benefits of learning to code for tangible computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for the desktop computer. For this purpose, 36 students participated in a within-groups study that involved three types of target computer platform tangibility. 1) desktop, 2) wearable, and 3) robotic. We employed similar blocks-based visual programming environments, and we measured emotional engagement, attitudes, and computer programming performance. We found that students were more engaged by and had a higher intention of learning programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible computing platforms, either robot or wearable, did not affect the students’ performance in learning basic computational concepts (e.g., sequence, repeat, and decision). Our findings suggest that computer programming should be introduced through multiple target platforms (e.g., robots, smartphones, wearables) to engage children.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Digital geographical maps can be regarded as a user interface for understanding and navigating the city. Nevertheless, contemporary digital maps over-emphasize the needs of motor vehicles. Pedestrian routes have only been considered as an add-on option in existing digital maps and the respective data collection has not been performed in the field. In this article, we present a mobile application that employs gamification as a means to engage users to collect pragmatic data about walkable routes, which are then processed with the goal of creating a new kind of pedestrian-friendly cartography. Besides the technical infrastructure for collecting and filtering the route traces, the main challenge in user-generated walkable routes is the identification of malicious data, which should be rejected, as well as the rewarding of constructive behavior through peer-review. For this purpose, the mobile application employs a point system in order to identify and discourage the submission of bad routes. A longitudinal field study of the mobile application confirmed that gamification facilitates effective data collection for producing pedestrian cartography even with few users and demonstrated that gamification infuses a shared responsibly about the quality of data collection. The visualization of the pedestrian-generated data on a map required a partially manual process, thus, further research should explore the gamification of the data visualization part, too.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Research into educational technology has evaluated new computer-based systems as tools for improving
students’ academic performance and engagement. Serious games should also be considered as an alternative pedagogical medium for
attracting students with different needs and expectations. In this field study, we empirically examined different forms of
serious-game use for learning on learning performance and attitudes of eighty 13-year-old students in the first grade of middle
school. Divided into four groups of 20 students, each group practiced with a maths video game in three ways. The first group
played the storytelling maths game, the second played the same game but with no story and the third played and modified the
video game. Finally, a control group practised in a paper-based (traditional) way by solving exercises. Although only minor
differences in learning performance were identified, we found significant differences in the attitudes of the students toward
learning through the video game. Students who are not motivated by conventional paper-based assignments might be engaged better
with the use of a video game. Our findings suggest that video game pedagogy could provide malleable learning for different
groups of students using methods that move beyond the conventional tool-based approach.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Epidemiology has made advances, thanks to the availability of real-time surveillance data and by leveraging
the geographic analysis of incidents. There are many health information systems that visualize the symptoms of influenza-like
illness on a digital map, which is suitable for end-users, but it does not afford further processing and analysis. Existing
systems have emphasized the collection, analysis, and visualization of surveillance data, but they have neglected a modular and
interoperable design that integrates high-resolution geo-location with real-time data. As a remedy, we have built an
open-source project and we have been operating an open service that detects flu-related symptoms and shares the data in
real-time with anyone who wants to built upon this system. An analysis of a small number of precisely geo-located status
updates (e.g. Twitter) correlates closely with the Google Flu Trends and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
flu-positive reports. We suggest that public health information systems should embrace an open- source approach and offer
linked data, in order to facilitate the development of an ecosystem of applications and services, and in order to be
transparent to the general public interest.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Co-located collaboration on large vertical screens has become technically feasible, but users are faced with
increased effort, or have to wear intrusive personal identifiers. Previous research on co-located collaboration has assumed
that all users perform exactly the same task (e.g., moving and resizing photos), or that they negotiate individual actions in
turns. However, there is limited user interface software that supports simultaneous performance of individual actions during
shared tasks (Fig. 1a). As a remedy, we have introduced multi-touch chords (Fig. 1b) and personal action windows (Fig. 1c) for
co-located collaboration on a large multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for
it, users work simultaneously on shared tasks by means of personal action windows, which are triggered by multi-touch chords
performed anywhere on the display. In order to evaluate the proposed technique with users, we introduced an experimental task,
which stands for the group dynamics that emerge during shared tasks on a large display. A grounded theory analysis of users’
behaviour provided insights into established co-located collaboration topics, such as conflict resolution strategies and space
negotiation. The main contribution of this work is the design and implementation of a novel seamless identification and
interaction technique that supports diverse multi-touch interactions by multiple users: multi-touch chord interaction along
with personal action windows.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Online video lectures have been considered an instructional media for various pedagogic approaches, such as
the flipped classroom and open online courses. In comparison to other instructional media, online video affords the opportunity
for recording student clickstream patterns within a video lecture. Video analytics within lecture videos may provide insights
into student learning performance and inform the improvement of video-assisted teaching tactics. Nevertheless, video analytics
are not accessible to learning stakeholders, such as researchers and educators, mainly because online video platforms do not
broadly share the interactions of the users with their systems. For this purpose, we have designed an open-access video
analytics system for use in a video-assisted course. In this paper, we present a longitudinal study, which provides valuable
insights through the lens of the collected video analytics. In particular, we found that there is a relationship between video
navigation (repeated views) and the level of cognition/thinking required for a specific video segment. Our results indicated
that learning performance progress was slightly improved and stabilized after the third week of the video-assisted course. We
also found that attitudes regarding easiness, usability, usefulness, and acceptance of this type of course remained at the same
levels throughout the course. Finally, we triangulate analytics from diverse sources, discuss them, and provide the lessons
learned for further development and refinement of video-assisted courses and practices.</span>

    <span class="notice">In this paper, we present a user-based event detection method for social web videos. Previous research in
event detection has focused on content-based techniques, such as pattern recognition algorithms that attempt to understand the
contents of a video. There are few user-centric approaches that have considered either search keywords, or external data such
as comments, tags, and annotations. Moreover, some of the user-centric approaches imposed an extra effort to the users in order
to capture required information. In this research, we are describing a method for the analysis of implicit users’ interactions
with a web video player, such as pause, play, and thirty-seconds skip or rewind. The results of our experiments indicated that
even the simple user heuristic of local maxima might effectively detect the same video-events, as indicated manually. Notably,
the proposed technique was more accurate in the detection of events that have a short duration, because those events motivated
increased user interaction in video hot-spots. The findings of this research provide evidence that we might be able to infer
semantics about a piece of unstructured data just from the way people actually use it.</span>

immediate benefit to pedestrians, a pragmatic understanding of walking paths might facilitate urban planning and design, which

    <span class="notice">We present a user-based method that detects regions of interest within a video, in order to provide video

recognition algorithms that attempt to understand the low-level features of a video. We are proposing a pulse modeling method,
which makes sense of a web video by analyzing users Replay interactions with the video player. In particular, we have modeled
the user information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. Then, we
have calculated the correlation coefficient between the dynamically detected pulses at the local maximums of the user activity
signal and the pulse of reference. We have found that users Replay activity significantly matches the important segments in
information-rich and visually complex videos, such as lecture, how-to, and documentary. The proposed signal processing of user

    <span class="notice">This work studies collective intelligence behavior of Web users that share and watch video content.
Accordingly, it is proposed that the aggregated users’ video activity exhibits characteristic patterns. Such patterns may be
used in order to infer important video scenes leading thus to collective intelligence concerning the video content. To this
end, experimentation is based on users’ interactions (e.g., pause, seek/scrub) that have been gathered in a controlled user
experiment with information-rich videos. Collective information seeking behavior is then modeled by means of the corresponding
probability distribution function. Thus, it is argued that the bell-shaped reference patterns are shown to significantly
correlate with predefined scenes of interest for each video, as annotated by the users. In this way, the observed collective
intelligence may be used to provide a video-segment detection tool that identifies the importance of video scenes. Accordingly,

    <span class="notice">There is growing interest in the employment of serious video games in science education, but there are no
clear design principles. After surveying previous work in serious video game design, we highlighted the following design
principles: 1) engage the students with narrative (hero, story), 2) employ familiar gameplay mechanics from popular video
games, 3) engage students into constructive trial and error game-play and 4) situate collaborative learning. As illustrated
examples we designed two math video games targeted to primary education students. The gameplay of the math video games embeds
addition operations in a seamless way, which has been inspired by that of classic platform games. In this way, the students are
adding numbers as part of popular gameplay mechanics and as a means to reach the video game objective, rather than as an end in
itself. The employment of well-defined principles in the design of math video games should facilitate the evaluation of
learning effectiveness by researchers. Moreover, educators can deploy alternative versions of the games in order to engage
students with diverse learning styles. For example, some students might be motived and benefited by narrative, while others by
collaboration, because it is unlikely that one type of serious video game might fit all learning styles. The proposed
principles are not meant to be an exhaustive list, but a starting point for extending the list and applying them in other cases
of serious video games beyond mathematics and learning.</span>

    <span class="notice">Informal learning settings, such as museums and cultural heritage locations, have employed interactive
mobile applications. Educators and museum curators recognise the value of interactivity, but the optimum level of interactivity
in informal learning remains unclear. We developed an informal learning activity with quiz questions about art theory, which we
integrated in a between–groups experimental design with three groups of high–school students at an art gallery. Each of the
three groups received a different treatment: (a) an interactive mobile–based learning activity, (b) a paper–based version of
the same learning activity, and (c) a self–guided museum tour. Students who enrolled with the interactive version showed higher
performance in the post–assessment test when compared to the paper–based version. Notably, the benefits of the interactive
version are attributed to the immediate feedback of the quiz application during the visit. Further research should perform
similar controlled experiments in order to assess the learning benefit of more immersive interactive systems, such as
three–dimensional graphics and augmented reality.</span>

    <span class="notice">This article investigates the uses and gratifications of the popular social networking site Facebook. In the
exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users not only
described the uses, but also mentioned how they perceive these uses. These phrases were coded into 14 items and clustered into
four factors. The principal component analysis that was conducted in the third stage of the study, which was addressed to 222
Facebook users, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection, Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time and Using
Applications. Previous user studies on Facebook have examined the immediate social effects of this popular social networking
site, but they have not regarded emerging uses of the platform, such as gaming and applications, which do have a social
component as a feature and not as a core principle. The ?Wasting Time? factor and the growth of ?Using Applications? factor
indicate that Facebook has already become an integral part of daily computing routine, alongside with the rest of the
entertainment desktop and web applications.</span>

    <span class="notice">Video-mediated communication (VMC) has become a feasible way to connect people in remote places for work and
play. Nevertheless, little research has been done with regard to children and VMC. In this paper, we explore the behavior of a
group of children, who exchanged video messages in an informal context. In particular, this paper presents the results of
11-week VMC study of 30 children from the USA and Greece, exploring children’s behavior with the asynchronous video-based
messaging tool we developed called VideoPal. In the study, children’s interactions, perceptions, content exchanged and emotions
were collected. The results from the analyses highlight that the emotion of happiness dominated in the communication. Moreover,
the content included useful personal information and is connected with children’s interactions (e.g., number of views and of
recipients). In addition, children generally preferred VideoPal to email because they felt that it was easier and has more
fun.</span>

    <span class="notice">We present a user-based approach for detecting interesting video segments through simple signal processing
of users collective interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). Previous research has focused on
content-based systems that have the benefit of analyzing a video without user interactions, but they are monolithic, because
the resulting key-frames are the same regardless of the user preferences. We developed the open-source SocialSkip system on a
modular cloud-based architecture and analyzed hundreds of user interactions within difficult video genres (lecture, how-to,
documentary) by modeling them as user interest time series. We found that the replaying activity is better than the skipping
forward one in matching the semantics of a video, and that all interesting video segments can be found within a factor of two
times the average user skipping step from the local maximums of the replay time series. The concept of simple signal processing
of implicit user interactions within video could be applied to any type of Web video system (e.g., TV, desktop, tablet), in
order to improve the user navigation experience with dynamic and personalized key-frames.</span>

    <span class="notice">The rapid development of digital media technologies enables the emergence of novel media content types for
eCommerce, eEducation, and digital entertainment. On the other hand, the advances in communication and micro-electronics have
led to a transition from traditional personal computer-centric to more intuitive human-centric information access modes and the
embedment of computer systems throughout the natural environment. This type of computation is generally known as Pervasive or
Ubiquitous Computing. It can also be referred to as ambient intelligence, or talking about media environments as ambient media.
It allows a person to use a variety of devices and sensor networks seamlessly embedded throughout our daily life, such as
personal digital assistant (PDA), smart electronics, sensors, as well as personal computer, to access those media contents. The
combination of these two trends (emergence of media and pervasive computing) holds the potential of providing a user with
seamless and ubiquitous access to rich and dynamic mul- timedia resources from anywhere and anytime.</span>

evaluated twenty-five icons from five different mobile phone handsets. It was found that there are significant differences

    <span class="notice">The introduction of mobile and broadband networks in complement to the existing satellite, cable, and
terrestrial platforms, opens new opportunities for interactive TV (ITV) applications. In addition, the widespread adoption of
multimedia computing has enabled the processing of TV content on personal devices such as mobile phones and PCs. The above
developments raise novel issues and require the adoption of new multimedia standards and application frameworks. In particular,
the explosion in the amount of available TV channels over digital television platforms (broadcast or internet protocol) makes
searching and locating interesting content a cumbersome task. In this context, personalization research is concerned with the
adaptation of content (e.g. movies, news, advertisements). Personalization is achieved with the employment of algorithms and
data collection schemes that predict and recommend to television viewers content that match their interests. In addition, the
distribution of TV content to mobile devices over broadband wireless raises the issue of video quality. Video quality depends
on many aspects of the video encoding systems, such as bit rate and algorithms that model human perception of video on small
screens. In this article, we examine contemporary research in personalized and mobile digital TV applications. Moreover, we
present a critical survey of the most prominent research and provide directions for further research in personalized and mobile
digital TV (DTV) applications.</span>

    <span class="notice">At first glance, the notion of social interactive television seems to be a tautology. Television watching
has always been a social activity. People watch television together in their living rooms, and outside their homes they talk
about last night’s football match; and even call each other to recommend an interesting program. Unfortunately, until recently,
research on social interactive television has been scarce. One limiting factor for the development of innovative services for
the home is the interactive technology behind user interaction, which was limited to the remote control. Fortunately, a number
of studies concentrate on extending interactive methods, for example by using contextual information. This article reviews the
state of the art in these two directions: the social aspects of television and user interaction. We conclude with a research
agenda for further research, which might transform current interactive television services into shared experiences.</span>

    <span class="notice">Interactive Television (ITV) applications gratify entertainment needs and leisure activities in a relaxed
domestic context. Then, the mentality of efficiency and task completion implied by many user interface heuristics may not be
suitable for design and expert evaluation of ITV. In line with the contemporary movement towards the design of the user
experience of computing systems, a set of design principles for ITV applications has been developed. Instead of information
technology, the field of communication science was explored, which has accumulated an extensive theory of TV usage and viewer
behavior. For the empirical validation, the principles were employed in the design of an interactive music TV application. The
results suggest that a small set of generic principles could support the systematic design of ITV applications and produce a
design rationale that is traceable and comparable to alternative solutions, during the process of early product development. In
addition, the principles could be refined into specific guidelines and further employed to support expert evaluation

    <span class="notice">Despite the progressive switch to digital TV, there has not been any significant change to the value chain
of the TV industry. At the same time, the introduction of novel information and communication technologies, such as the digital
video recorder (DVR) and efficient Peer-to-Peer (P2P) content distribution, have been regarded as a threat to the established
broadcast business players. Previous research has described these threats and has suggested competitive strategies, but it has
not investigated the opportunities. This work aims to identify a framework of new business models that take advantage of the
networked DVR. For this purpose, we examined the TV literature from diverse academic disciplines, such as mass communication,
computer engineering and advertising research. We have also collaborated with network and multimedia engineers, with
broadcasters, and we examined novel interactive television (ITV) prototypes. The findings suggest that the networked DVR could
be exploited to provide personalized channels and that the dynamic advertising insertion could be introduced as an effective

been well-received by end-users. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of an animated character for presenting
information and navigating music videos within an interactive television (ITV) application. Information was displayed over
music video clips with two alternative user interfaces: 1) semi-transparent information overlays, 2) an animated character. For
this purpose, the differences between ITV and desktop computing motivated the adaptation of the traditional usability
evaluation techniques. The evaluation revealed that users reported higher affective quality with the animated character user

advertising formats are important issues for research and practice. We explore the employment of an animated character and the
dynamic insertion of advertising in the design of an intuitive user interface for interactive music-video television. We found
that the animated character and the skippable videoclip feature seamlessly enhanced consumer satisfaction, as shown by
affective usability questionnaires.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Embodiment within robotics can serve as an innovative approach to attracting students to computer programming. Nevertheless, there is a limited number of empirical studies in authentic classroom environments to support this assumption. In this study, we explored the synergy between embodied learning and educational robotics through a series of programming activities. Thirty-six middle school students were asked to create applications for controlling a robot using diverse interaction modalities, such as touch, speech, hand and full body gestures. We measured students’ preferences, views, and intentions. Further- more, we evaluated students’ interaction modalities selections during a semi- open problem-solving task. The results revealed that students felt more confident about their programming skills after the activities. Moreover, participants chose interfaces that were attractive to them and congruent to the programming tasks.</span>

    <span class="notice">We designed and evaluated an exertion video game in order to overcome two challenges that are preventing
exergames from becoming a viable sustained exercise alternative; insufficient physical exertion and player retention. This was
achieved by implementing common features shared by the most popular video games and seamlessly merging them with the exertion
found in exergames. A user study was performed where the exergame was played 132 times over three days by 8 participants.
Compared to the control condition, a moderately paced walk, the exergame scored better on both subjective enjoyment and degree
of physical activity. Further research could consider alternative versions of exergames, as well as different user groups.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">With the increasing use of multi-touch (MT) capable devices, MT interaction has become a commodity during
the last years. From personal devices to larger multi-user screens, MT functionality is nowadays considered as a standard way
of performing rich interactions. However, moving from a single-touch interaction to a dual-touch and consequently to MT is not
always without challenges for the average user. Although, the use of single-touch is very common, interaction design have yet
to be examined thoroughly by taking into account potential differences of single and multi-touch functionality. In this work,
we investigate the potential of a two-finger chord button in comparison to the traditional single touch buttons that we find in
touchscreens. Based on the fact that users are familiar with single touch buttons (even before the MT screens) our hypotheses
are: the use of a two finger chord button a) decreases users’ efficiency, and b) delays users’ responses. In order to
investigate our hypotheses, we conducted a controlled experiment with 12 users working on an appropriately designed MT
application. The empirical results have indicated that the use of two-finger button significantly delays users’ response-time
while it does not affect users’ efficiency on the performed task.</span>

    <span class="notice">Digital geographical maps have become an important part of many websites and mobile applications. For
example, we can embed a map and geo-location tracking into a web page, or into a smartphone application. Nevertheless, the
management of user maps and routes is different between the many competing geographic information services. We designed and
implemented an open-source and linked-data web service for facilitating the process of a map and route management. The
implementation of our open-source web application has been built on-top of existing web services that provide maps. In this
way, the Mapito.org service provides an open abstraction layer above the proprietary implementations of commercial companies.
Notably, the Mapito platform provides an Application Programming Interface (API), which facilitates the creation and editing of
a map and the ability to download the data, or routes without visiting the Web-based user interface. In this paper, we outline
the system and provide representative case studies.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Learning to program in computer code has been considered one of the pillars of contemporary education with
benefits that reach well beyond the skills required by the computing industry, into creativity and self-expression.
Nevertheless, the execution of computer programs usually takes place on a traditional desktop computer, which has a limited
repertoire of input and output interfaces to engage with the user. On the other hand, pedagogy has emphasized that physical
representations and tangible interactive objects benefit learning especially for young students. In this work, we explore the
benefits of learning to code for ubiquitous computers, such as robots and wearable computers, in comparison to programming for
the desktop computer. For this purpose, thirty-six students participated in a within groups study that involved three types of
tangibility at the target computer platform: 1) desktop with Scratch, 2) wearable with Arduino LilyPad, and 3) robotic with
Lego Mindstorms. Regardless of the target platform, we employed the same desktop visual programming environment (MIT Scratch,
Modkit and Enchanting) and we measured emotional engagement and assessed students’ programming skills. We found that students
expressed more positive emotions while programming with the robotic rather than the desktop computer. Furthermore, tangible
computing platforms didn’t affect dramatically students’ performance in computational thinking.</span>

    <span class="notice">The need for more experimental data, but also quicker and cheaper, lead us beyond traditional lab
experiments, approaching a new subject pool via a crowdsourcing platform. SocialSkip is an open system that leverages the video
clickstream data for extracting useful information about the video content and the viewers. The difficulty of embedding a
pre-existing system as a task demands a carefully designed interface, adjusting experiments and be aware of workers’ cheating
behavior. We present a replicable task design and by analyzing crowdsourced results, we highlight problems in experimental
procedure and propose potential solutions for future crowdsourcing experiments. The proposed crowdsourcing methodology achieved
the collection of a significant amount of video clickstream data, in a timely manner and with affordable cost. Our findings
indicate that future social media analytics systems should include an integrated crowdsourcing module. Further research should
focus on collecting more data by controlling the random worker behavior a priori.</span>

    <span class="notice">Despite the increasing use of Multi-Touch (MT) capable devices, novel interaction techniques need to be
examined in order to swift from a single-touch WIMP interaction paradigm to a MT one.In this work, we focus on chord
interaction on vertical MT screens. Chord is the simultaneous touch of more than one finger on the MT screen. Based on a user
experiment with 12 users, we explore the positioning - interaction space of the chord technique, by investigating a relation
among the type of the chord (number of fingers) and the position on the screen that the chord was applied. The empirical
results have indicated an interaction pattern that demonstrates a significant relation between the type of the chord that was
applied (number of fingers) and its position on the screen. Our results show that as the number of fingers needed for a chord
increases, the nearer from the bottom left of the screen this chord is to be applied. Notably, our results give evidence of the
fact that there is a threshold (five-finger-chord) beyond which the above relation is not strong.</span>

    <span class="notice">Computer programming skills in younger ages seem to be a promising and challenging aspect. Many visual
programming tools have been developed in order to assist young students and to improve the current teaching practices and
pedagogies. In this paper, we explore the potential effects of a Project Based Learning (PjBL) approach in the field of
computer programming. In particular, we try to identify potential differences on students’ programming habits/styles, between
game development, simulation, and traditional learning strategy, in the context of PjBL. Our sample consisted of 53 middle
school students who formed three groups. Introducing programming through a serious game development approach might inspire
students towards a creative learning experience. Moreover, parameters like the class formation might affect the development of
programming skills. The students in the PjBL treatment were able to complete a project successfully making fewer mistakes. On
the other hand, students enrolled in a more traditional top-down approach chose to experiment with more complex curriculum but
not always successfully.</span>

    <span class="notice">Educational games have been employed in many settings as a means to engage young students. Different genres
and applications of games have been used to improve learning experience. The design or making of games in learning activities
has been linked to teaching of new skills. Within this paper we explore and discuss the differences of involving young students
into the game design and development process compared to just playing an educational game. In particular, we designed an
educational math-game and an activity that involves children in playing or modifying the game, and we performed a between
groups experiment with sixty students of the second grade of middle school (12 to 13 years old). Students formed three
equivalent groups of twenty. The first group played the game, the second engaged with re-designing and modifying the game and
the third (control) group solved the same exercises (with the educational game) on paper. The results showed that the making
group exhibits certain attitudinal benefits. Hence, our findings suggest that learning through games should include more than
just playing a well-designed game, it should also consider the involvement of students with various making affordances.</span>

    <span class="notice">During the last few years, the focus of computer science education (CSE) in primary and secondary schools
(shortly K-12) have reached a significant turning point. This study reviews the published papers on the field of K-12 computing
education in order to summarize the findings, guide future studies and give reflections for the major achievements in the area
of CSE in K-12 schools. 47 peer-reviewed articles were collected from a systematic literature search and analyzed, based on a
categorization of their main elements. Programming tools, educational context, and instructional methods are the main examined
categories of this research. Results of this survey show the direction of CSE in schools research during the last years and
summarized the benefits as well as the challenges. In particular, we analyzed the selected papers from the perspective of the
various instructional methods aiming at introducing and enhancing learning, using several programming tools and educational
context in K-12 CSE. Despite the challenges, the findings suggest that implementing computing lessons in K-12 education could
be an enjoyable and effective learning experience. In addition, we suggest ways to facilitate deep learning and deal with
various implications of the formal and informal education. Encouraging students to create their own projects or solve problems
should be a significant part of the learning process.</span>

characteristics that come from the social network users. A special interesting data category concerns the data that come from
the natural language present in the social media mainly in the form of video. Our study focuses on the speech content of the
videos in the form of transcript and the opinion of the social network users that have watched them. The representation of
content data is made through a vector space model that uses cosine similarity measure for the relevant ranking of the
transcripts. In order for the ranking to be more comprehensive we suggest the addition of a new parameter that of social weight
during the procedure, which will reflect the users’ opinion. There is an analytic presentation of the method being suggested;
all the possible cases are being examined and the rules that define the new ranking are put forward. Furthermore, we apply this
method to video lectures derived from YouTube. The findings of the experiments show that the addition of the social weight
parameter reflects the users’ views without changing to great extent the content based ranking of the video lectures. Finally,
a user evaluation experiment was carried out and showed that the ranking procedure that includes the social weight parameter is

video analytics to represent learner behavior. Further research, should be able to elaborate on learner behavior by collecting
large-scale data. In this way, the producers of online video pedagogy will be able to understand the use of this emerging

engage the students with a story and a hero, 2) employ familiar game mechanics from popular video games, and 3) provide
constructive trial and error gameplay for learning. As an illustrating example of those principles, we designed a video game
that teaches addition and subtraction of signed numbers. Finally, we outline several more serious games that have adopted the
above design principles. The results should be useful for designers, teachers, and researchers who work in the area of serious

    <span class="notice">The recent rise in popularity of Twitter and its open API provides developers the opportunity to extract
amounts of data which can be a thesaurus of information. This opportunity led to the development of an open source and open API
system called Flu track (http://flutrack.org) that monitors influenza epidemics, based on geo-located self-reports on Twitter.
In particular, we detect words such as sore throat, cough, fever etc. Moreover, we detect the aggravation of a patient’s
clinical condition when a user posts a second flu related tweet that contains words indicating further symptoms such as: worse,
deteriorating. Finally, we present flu-positives with real time anonymous visualizations using maps (mapping), which might be
helpful for authorities and sensitive populations to plan upcoming events or activities. In order to further aid the
surveillance of the spreading of the disease, a classification experiment has been conducted for automatically identifying
Tweets that describe cases with acute and more critical symptoms from those referring to milder cases. We found that making use

    <span class="notice">Teachers have employed online video as an element of their instructional media portfolio, alongside with
books, slides, notes, etc. In comparison to other instructional media, online video affords more opportunities for recording of
student navigation on a video lecture. Video analytics might provide insights into student learning performance and inform the
improvement of teaching tactics. Nevertheless, those analytics are not accessible to learning stakeholders, such as researchers

online video platforms do not share the interactions of the users with their systems. Nevertheless, video learning analytics
are necessary to all researchers and teachers that need to understand and improve the effectiveness of the video lecture

learning analytics service (named Social Skip) facilitates the analysis of video learning behavior by capturing learners’
interactions with the video player (e.g., seek/scrub, play, pause). The service empowers any researcher or teacher to create a
custom video-based experiment by selecting: 1) a video lecture from You Tube, 2) quiz questions from Google Drive, and 3)
custom video player buttons. The open video analytics system has been validated through dozens of user studies, which produced
thousands of video interactions. In this study, we present an indicative example, which highlights the usability and usefulness
of the system. In addition to interaction frequencies, the system models the captured data as a learner activity time series.
Further research should consider user modeling and personalization in order to dynamically respond to the interactivity of

    <span class="notice">Contemporary digital maps provide an option for pedestrian navigation, but they do not account for
subjective preferences in the calculation of the shortest path, which is usually provided in terms of absolute distance. For
this purpose, we performed a controlled experiment with local pedestrians, who were asked to navigate from point A to point B
in a fast manner. The pedestrians’ routes were recorded by means of a GPS device and then plotted on a map for comparison with
suggested itinerary from a digital map. We found that the preferred shortest path is significantly different to the suggested
one. Notably, the preffered paths were slightly longer than the suggested, but there was no effect in the trip duration because
there were fewer obstacles, such as cars. Since many pedestrians employ GPS enabled devices, the findings of this research
inform the development of mobile applications and the design of new subjective map layers for city dwellers.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Computer programming has become an important skill and it can be taught from early school years. Previous
research has developed and evaluated several visual programming tools that are suitable for computer education in schools.
However, little is known about how pedagogic styles affect student attitudes towards learning computer programming. This paper
reports on a preliminary study on the influence of alternative teaching styles on student’s enjoyment and attitude towards
computing. Two groups of twelve students each were asked to revise a computer game. The traditional instruction group was
provided with detailed information, while the encouragement group was asked to help the teacher to change the variables of the
game. The results indicate that an encouraging pedagogic style promotes more positive attitudes towards computer programming
and more self-confidence than traditional instruction. Further research should repeat the experiment across several weeks for
more programming concepts and should also assess the cognitive benefits.</span>

    <span class="notice">Many educational organizations are motivated to create and share instructional videos, but there are no
guidelines about the presentation styles. In practice, the presentation style of video lectures ranges from simple video
capturing of classroom teaching, up to highly elaborate authoring of video presentations that include close-ups and video-cuts
of instructors, slides, animations, and interactive drawing boards. In particular, there is limited research about the effects
of each presentation style on student learning performance and attitudes. In this work, we examine the effects of video
presentation styles in supporting the teaching of mathematics in the secondary education. In addition to a control group that
studied through a paper-book, two groups of students attended two distinct styles of video lectures: 1) video capture of class
teaching (Talking head style), and 2) close-up video capture of an interactive drawing board with voice-over (Khan style). The
participants of our study consisted of 36 students (15 boys and 21 girls, 16 years old), who received the respective three
treatments (paper book, talking head, khan style), over the course of three math modules in three weeks’ time. We found that
learning effects show up only after the second week and that the Talking Head style was more effective than the book for
complex topics.</span>

    <span class="notice">Sports tracking software for casual exercising has become popular with smart phone users who are concerned
about their health and fitness. Nevertheless, there is limited research on the user requirements for sports tracking software,
which needs to be fun and easy to use in order to appeal to a broad set of users. For this purpose, we employed a four-week
long experiment with five users who were asked to perform multiple workouts with two levels of gamification. The first
treatment stands for no gamification and the second treatment provided rich visual feedback, such as speed, distance, elapsed
time, map. At the end of the experiment, we asked users to describe the devices. Both devices included GPS sensor, so we also
measured the distance covered for each one of the workouts. We found that augmented feedback from mobile self-tracking devices
can promote working out, but there is also a trade-off of increased anxiety and disorientation. Thus, we suggest that sports
tracking software should be modest about how much and what type of visual information it provides to the user. In particular,
we found that the only piece of visual information that had an impact on performance was average speed, which indicates a
connection with gamication. Further research should consider additional levels of gamification beyond score, such as graphics,
sociability, rules.</span>

    <span class="notice">Serious video games have been proposed as a means to engage students with the Science, Technology,
Engineering, Mathematics (STEM) curric-ulum, but there is limited research on the required game elements and teaching
practices. In particular, there is limited evidence on the effects of the storytelling element and of student involvement in
making games on the learning performance and on the attitudes of the students. For this purpose, we designed a between groups
experiment with eighty students (12 to 13 years old). They formed three equivalent groups of twenty students each who practiced
with a serious game in three different ways. The first group played the storytelling game, the second played the same game but
with no story, and the third was engaged with modifying the game code. Finally, the last (control) group practiced
traditionally by solving exercises on paper. We found that girls with low grades benefited the most by playing the game and by
engaging with the code and that the game making group wishes to repeat the exercise. Further research should perform similar
studies with a focus on involving students in serious game modification, over longer periods of time and for additional
curriculum topics.</span>

information about user search behavior with regard to recently time-shifted versus archival TV content. We deployed two
distinct content-based web services to explore information retrieval of time-shifted TV content. The first web service is based
on a browsing metaphor, while the second is based on free text content search metaphor. We analyzed more than 5000 user
sessions from 12 months of logs and found that the programs accessed via browsing categorized program content summaries were
typically less than one week old. In contrast, the programs accessed via free text search on subtitle content were typically
more than a week old. Our findings provide a first assessment of user behavior in accessing time-shifted and archival TV

    <span class="notice">There is a growing number and variety of educational video lectures online, but there is limited
understanding of their effectiveness in terms of learning and usability. Although there is significant research literature
within the individual domains of usability and of video learning, there is limited understanding of their integrated design. In
particular, there is limited research on guidelines for usable video lecture design, such as the presence of humans in the
video and navigation support through the video. For example, it is established that learners benefit from highly structured
learning material, but the manual editing of video is not feasible for most learning organizations and instructors. In order to
accommodate this emerging instruction medium we are drawing design principles and models from the research literature on
educational technology and video interaction. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive approach to the design of usable video
lecture systems and content. Finally, we suggest that learning organizations and instructors should invest additional effort in

player. The story and the mission are used to stimulate the students’ interest and motivate them to play the game. The
empirical study is a controlled experiment to which 46 Gymnasium (middle school) students participated. Results confirmed the
positive effects of the enjoyment on students’ intention to use storytelling serious games. Notably, we found that gender has a

right level of interactivity in informal learning settings, such as museums. In this study, we explore the effect of in-
creasing levels of interactivity on learning performance and students’ intention for future museum visits. We developed an
educational mobile application based on QR codes and quiz software, in order to augment visual arts comprehension during a
visit to an art gallery. In addition to the mobile-based version of the game, a paper-based version was also employed followed
by a controlled experiment. A total of 60 lyceum students (between 15 and 16 years old) participated in a between-groups
evaluation that compared the performance of three levels of interactivity (passive guided tour, paper-based, mobile-based), as
well as the perceptions among the groups. The results indicate that the mobile-based student group had higher performance in
the post-assessment when compared with the paper-based one. Notably, perceived interest for the game affects students’
perceptions for a future museum visit. Further research should consider the effects of higher-fidelity types of mobile
applications, such as 3D graphics, as well as augmented-reality games.</span>

The research question is: How can we design and evaluate software that becomes a medium to engage and inform the user? We have
gathered empirical data during a two days exhibition of two versions of a pervasive art installation by: observations,
questionnaires, and input logs. Data analysis reveals that the art installation engaged users, with focus on young children,
and communicated the intended message. The results are organized according to five important factors for developing and
evaluating interacting art installations. These are: 1) data collection method; 2) user interaction; 3) social interaction; 4)
issues about children; 5) message comprehension. We suggest that these factors can inform engineering practices for engaging

    <span class="notice">Semantic video research has employed crowdsourcing techniques on social web video data sets such as
comments, tags, and annotations, but these data sets require an extra effort on behalf of the user. We propose a pulse modeling
method, which analyzes implicit user interactions within web video, such as rewind. In particular, we have modeled the user
information seeking behavior as a time series and the semantic regions as a discrete pulse of fixed width. We constructed these
pulses from user interactions with a documentary video that has a very rich visual style with too many cuts and camera
angles/frames for the same scene. Next, we calculated the correlation coefficient between dynamically detected user pulses at
the local maximums and the reference pulse. We have found when people are actively seeking for information in a video, their
activity (these pulses) significantly matches the semantics of the video. This proposed pulse analysis method complements
previous work in content-based information retrieval and provides an additional user-based dimension for modeling the semantics
of a web video.</span>

generations. However, traditional technologies have several limitations in supporting pen pal activities. In this study, we
explored the potential of video-based asynchronous messaging in supporting the development of children’s cross-cultural
friendships. This paper presents the results of a 2-month study of 30 children from the USA and Greece, exploring their uses
of, and experiences with, email and an asynchronous video-based messaging tool we developed called VideoPal. The results from
this work highlight the important benefits video provides compared to its text counterpart - email. We conclude with a
discussion of the key factors that video enables to benefit the development of children’s long-distance friendships.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Video-mediated communication (VMC) has become a feasible way to connect people in remote places for work and
play. Nevertheless, little research has been done with regard to children and VMC. In this paper, we explore the behavior of a
group of children, who exchanged video messages in an informal context. In particular, we have analyzed 386 videos over a
period of 11 weeks, which were exchanged by 30 students of 4 th and 5 th grade from USA and Greece. We found that the number of
views and the duration of a video message significantly depend on the gender of the viewer and creator. Most notably, girls
created more messages, but boys viewed their own messages more. Finally, there are video messages with numerous views, which
indicates that some videos have content qualities beyond the communication message itself. Overall, the practical implications
of these findings indicate that the developers of asynchronous VMC should consider functionalities for preserving some of the
video messages.</span>

    <span class="notice">In this paper, we present a system that facilitates the analysis of user activity within a web video.
Previous research in user-based techniques has assumed an extra effort from the users, such as video replies, comments, tags,
and annotations. We have developed and evaluated the SocialSkip system, which improves sense making of web videos by
visualizing the simplest form of user interactions with video, such as pause, and seek. In contrast to previous stand-alone
implementations, the SocialSkip system employs a web-video player and cloud-based resources (application logic, database,
content). The system was validated with two user studies, which provided several hundreds of user interactions with five types
of web video (sports, comedy, lecture, documentary, how-to). We found that seeking activity within web video is reversely
proportional to how interesting the video is. Moreover, we suggest that if the users are actively seeking for information
within a video (e.g., lecture, how-to), then the user activity graph could be associated with the semantics of the video.
Finally, SocialSkip provides an open architecture for collaborative contributions to the analysis of the user activity data, in
a fashion similar to the TRECVID workshop series.</span>

    <span class="notice">In this paper, we present an updated set of experimental tasks and measures for large multi-touch (MT) input
devices. In addition to a multi-user condition, we have employed an updated set of tasks, as well as subjective measures for
user enjoyment. In the first experiment (a target acquisition task with two moving targets), the MT was more efficient than the
mouse. Surprisingly, we found that the reduced accuracy of MT did not affect the perceived usability, or the enjoyment of the
users. In the second experiment (a multiple shapes docking task), the MT was again more efficient and enjoying than the mouse.
In the two-user condition, we found that performance and enjoyment was always higher than the single-user conditions,
regardless of input device and task. Besides the quantitative results, we observed that users employed diverse interaction
strategies in the MT condition, such as bi-manual input. The proposed tasks and the results support the use of MT in
entertainment applications (multimedia and video-games), collaborative work, and scientific visualizations with complex data.</span>

    <span class="notice">Many schools are replacing traditional whiteboards with interactive versions connected to computers and
operated with a digital pen. Previous research has established that interactive whiteboards facilitate the learning activities,
but there is limited research on the usability of the available digital pens. In particular, the Wiimote project is a cheap
interactive whiteboard that employs an infrared pen, which is available in two versions: 1) push button and 2) tip activated.
The push button is a pen which functions is similar to that of a mouse and the tip activated is a pen that acts like a "real"
pen. In this article, we present an experiment that compares the usability of two infrared pens (push button and tip activated)
in a target acquisition and a docking task. In addition to those typical input device tasks, we developed a more realistic
drawing task, in order to assess the accuracy of each input device. We found that the tip activated pen is more usable, more
accurate, and creates less fatigue.</span>

    <span class="notice">In this work, we present the design and implementation of a chorded menu for multiple users on a large
multi-touch vertical display. Instead of selecting an item in a fixed menu by reaching for it, users make a selection by
touching multiple fingers simultaneously on any place of the display. Previous research on multi-touch toolkits has provided
basic access to touch events, but there is no support for advanced user interface widgets, such as chords. For this purpose, we
extended the open-source PyMT toolkit with an architecture that supports alternative user interaction strategies with chorded
menus. In addition, we built a multi-user extension that supports chords for two or more users. Chords could be used for having
user-aware MT applications. Our toolkit is open source and has been designed as a widget that could be integrated into broader
interaction frameworks for multi-touch screens.</span>

    <span class="notice">The introduction and wide adoption of small and powerful mobile computers, such as smart phones and tablets,
has raised the opportunity of employing them into multi-device scenarios and blending the distinction between input and output
devices. In particular, the partnership between a personal device and a shared one provides two possible output screens. Then,
one significant research issue is to balance the visual interface between two devices with advanced output abilities. Do the
devices compete or cooperate for the attention and the benefit of the user? Most notably, how multi-device interaction is
appreciated in multi-user scenarios? Previous research has raised and considered the above research issues and questions for
dual screen set-ups in the work environment. In our research, we are exploring multi-device user interface configurations in
the context of a leisure environment and for entertainment applications. Our objective is to provide interaction possibilities

    <span class="notice">This paper investigates the uses of the popular social networking site Facebook, and the perceptions of the
users which derive from their Facebook experience. In the exploratory stage, 70 users generated phrases to describe the manner
they used Facebook. Interestingly, some users do not only describe the uses, but also mention how they perceive these uses.
These phrases were coded into 14 items and then clustered into 4 factors. The second stage of the study, which was addressed to
131 Facebook users, the factor analysis that was conducted, verified the validity of the four factors: Social Connection,
Social Network Surfing, Wasting Time, Using Applications. Finally, the results were analyzed in order to interpret each
factor’s impact and to enable a comparison with previous research regarding the same subject. These showed how users continue
to primarily regard Facebook as a means of socializing with other users, but also the extent to which Facebook has become a
part of their daily routine, something that is indicated by the impact of the "Wasting Time" factor. Further research can be
conducted by addressing a greater number of users, selected with a less random manner and possibly with a different (cultural,
economical etc.) background.</span>

    <span class="notice">The focus of this article is the link between video sharing and interpersonal communication on the internet.
Previous works on social television systems belong to two categories: 1) studies on how collocated groups of viewers socialize
while watching TV, and 2) studies on novel Social TV applications (e.g. experimental set-ups) and devices (e.g. ambient
displays) that provide technological support for TV sociability over a distance. The main shortcoming of those studies is that
they have not considered the dominant contemporary method of Social TV. Early adopters of technology have been watching and
sharing video online. We employed cultural probes in order to gain in-depth information about the social aspect of video
sharing on the internet. Our sample consisted of six heavy users of internet video, watching an average of at least one hour of
internet video a day. In particular, we explored how they are integrating video into their daily social communication
practices. We found that internet video is shared and discussed with distant friends. Moreover, the results of the study
indicate several opportunities and threats for the development of integrated mass and interpersonal communication applications

interactive TV as content creation, 2) interactive TV as a content and experience sharing process, and 3) interactive TV as
control of audiovisual content. We propose this simple taxonomy (create-share-control) as an evolutionary step over the
traditional hierarchical produce-distribute-consume paradigm. Moreover, we highlight the importance of sociability in all

    <span class="notice">Television use does not require high skill or effort, which is ideal as a paradigm of use for ambient user
interfaces. In this paper, universal access in ambient intelligence is modeled after the use of TV in everyday life. Instead of
considering television only as a content medium and the focus of user activity, an alternative approach is to consider
television use as a secondary function to other activities, such as socializing, domestic chores, leisure pursuits. For this
purpose, the requirements for ambient user interactivity with TV are organized in a small set of design principles. The design
principles have been selected, analyzed and synthesized from readings in previous works on media and ethnographic studies about
television, and everyday life. It is suggested that universal access in ambient intelligence is promoted by considering design
principles such as opportunistic interaction, user participation, group interactions, and multiple levels of attention to the
user interface. Finally, the principles have been tested in the design of a user interface for interactive music television.
This preliminary case suggests that the proposed principles facilitate the design of user interfaces that blend seamlessly with
everyday life.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">Our everyday lives are characterised by encounters, some are fleeting and ephemeral and others are more
enduring and meaningful exchanges. Shared encounters are the glue of social networks and have a socializing effect in terms of
mutual understanding, empathy, respect and thus tolerance towards others. The quality and characteristics of such encounters
are affected by the setting, or situation in which they occur. In a world shaped by communication technologies, non-place-based
networks often coexist alongside to the traditional local face-to-face social networks. As these multiple and distinct on and
off-line communities tend to carry out their activities in more and more distinct and sophisticated spaces, a lack of coherency
and fragmentation emerges in the sense of a shared space of community. Open public space with its streets, parks and squares
plays an important role in providing space for shared encounters among and between these coexisting networks. Mobile and
ubiquitous technologies enable social encounters located in public space, albeit not confined to fixed settings, whilst also
offering sharing of experiences from non-place based networks. We will look at how to create or support the conditions for
meaningful and persisting shared encounters. In particular we propose to explore how technologies can be appropriated for
shared interactions that can occur spontaneously and playfully and in doing so re-inhabit and connect place-based social
networks.</span>

    <span class="notice">In this paper, we present a series of methods developed by the artist, Michelle Teran, for raising awareness
ofinvisible spaces created by public wireless communication technologies. These methods include public performance, w here
participation is through a series of walks through the city, and workshops where participants engage in the design implications
through a process oflocating, examining and documenting some ofthese invisible networks. Overall, we explore methods and
strategies for engaging the public, how to create awareness ofthe limitations oftheir perception of communications technologies
and techniques that facilitate the debate on the opportunities that these invisible yet rich in meaning invisible spaces might
raise.</span>

    <span class="notice">Interactive digital television is an emerging field with a high impact in our societies: it offers
interactive services to the masses. This tutorial aims to establish a common framework by summarizing the most significant
results in this multidisciplinary field. The review includes topics such as content distribution, system software of the
receivers, and user interaction. In addition, we will discuss current commercial events such as the next generation of optical
discs (e.g., blue-ray), BBC peer-to-peer service, and mobile television. Based on this discussion, we will formulate an agenda
for further research. The agenda includes, for example, end-user enrichment of television content and social television. This
half-day tutorial will provide the attendee a solid understanding of the technologies currently in use and an introduction of
the open questions in the field.</span>

    <span class="notice">Digital music consumers have to choose between illegal file swapping services and online music stores. The
latter impose various restrictions to the established music consumption behaviour, such as limitations on the number of devices
and proprietary music formats. We describe a business model that is based on a liberal management of music rights, instead of
the dominant restrictions of access. The proposed business model facilitates the free flow of music content between different
client devices (PC, mobile phone, portable player) and between heterogeneous networks (Web, P2P, wireless, broadcast), but it
controls the flow of rights for added value music bundles. The business model is presented over two stages of the customer
activity cycle and along the revenue, process and technology elements.</span>

    <span class="notice">The purpose of this paper is to present our experience from the design of a personalized television
application, and the implications for the design of interactive television applications in general. Personalized advertising is
a gentle introduction to interactive television applications through a push paradigm that is closer to the established patterns
of television use. While personalization is a practice widely used on the Internet, applying personalization techniques over
digital television infrastructures presents significant obstacles, which we address with explicit design moves</span>

    <span class="notice">Traditional human-computer interaction settings involve a task-oriented approach where the human interacts
with an application to accomplish a particular goal. The emergence of media-rich computer-mediated leisure applications
requires a fresh view of the current paradigms and a careful examination of how this change of perspective affects their
relevance. This paper proposes a metaphor for accessing personalized television programming and suggests an approach for
integrating the metaphor into the design of a television user interface. The proposed metaphor is tested in the design of a
personalized advertising service. The results of the empirical research are discussed and the suitability of the metaphor for
other television programs is examined.</span>

    <span class="notice">This research is based on the realization that the desktop computing paradigm is not appropriate for
television, because it is adapted to fundamentally different user aspirations and activities. Instead, the virtual channel is
proposed as a model that explains the proper design of user access to personalized television programming. The virtual channel
is a model that aids the organization and dynamic presentation of television programming from a combination of live broadcasts,
prerecorded content and Internet resources at each set-top box. In this paper, we describe two applications that have been used
to validate the virtual channel model. We have employed the properties of the virtual channel model into the design of
personalized television advertising and interactive music video clip programming. Finally, we describe an ActiveX control that
implements a core set of the virtual channels features.</span>

    <span class="notice">This paper uses the well-established ?uses and gratifications? theory in order to understand and categorize
viewers? needs in the context of digital TV applications. The results of this analysis unveil that such needs can either be
ritualized or instrumental. Furthermore, the uses and gratifications theory was applied in order to formulate a questionnaire
to which 68 current users of digital TV responded. The results of this empirical study reveal that applications most suitable
for the interactive television environment should aim at the gratification of ritualized needs, such as entertainment and
communication. Therefore, applications that appeal to instrumental needs, such as information and transactions should be
included as add-ons to entertainment and communication services. Finally, the implications of this analysis for the design of
interactive television applications are exploited.</span>

    <span class="notice">Following the case of the Internet, Interactive TV can be expected to revolutionise marketing practices and
lead to a paradigm shift in the way advertising is developed, conducted, and analysed. Interactive TV, combines the appeal and
mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available on the Web and offers new
possibilities for the viewer, who can directly access relevant information and other services being just one-click away. In
this context, personalisation of advertisements refers to the use of technology and viewer information in order to tailor
commercials and their respective interactive content to each individual viewer profile. In this paper we deal with the topic of
advertising over digital interactive TV and describe a specific approach to the delivery of personalised interactive
advertisement content to viewers based on their individual profile, focusing on the necessary architecture, mechanisms and user
interface issues which reveal a challenging research domain.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">This paper presents the innovative approach of the IST project iMEDIA towards Consumer Clustering and
Targeted Advertising in a Digital TV Environment. iMEDIA covers the need of Advertising Companies to identify broad classes of
TV viewers who will respond similarly to marketing actions, and thus develop their target advertising techniques. The consumers
are equipped with a settop box (STB) with storage facilities and a modem. The definition of consumer profiles and clusters is
based on demographics, preferences, and analysis of the consumer interactions with the TV, which are tracked automatically. In
order to protect consumers’ identities, consumer data are stored locally on the STB and the classification of a consumer in a
specific cluster takes place at the client side. Consumer data from the consumers, who permit it, is periodically transferred
to the Server where Data Mining techniques are applied. The extracted consumer behavioral rules associate the clusters with
consumer profiles and interaction/navigational data and are sent through the broadcast channel to the consumers’ STBs for the
classification of each consumer and the playback of the advertisements that match consumer interests.</span>

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    <span class="notice">The birth of the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1993, particularly its graphical user interface, offered marketers
opportunities that were previously unimaginable. The WWW allows advanced marketing activities and more particularly interactive
marketing, as the user is actively involved in responding to the vendor’s promotion campaign. Interactive TV, also referred to
as iTV, combines the appeal and mass audience of traditional TV with the interactive features such as those currently available
on the Web. Although personalisation is a practice used widely on the Internet by many sites, applying personalisation
techniques over interactive television presents a number of difficulties. In this paper we focus on the design and testing
process of the User Interface (UI) for the Interactive & Personalized Advertisement TV viewer. We argue that there are a lot
of challenges involved in the designing of interactive TV applications. These are related with the differences of the medium
from the traditional PC based Information Systems in terms of input and output devices, viewing environment, number of users
and low level of expertise in PC usage.</span>
